# Website Design Ideas and Brainstorm

## Introduction

I designed this project based on the moodboard repository.
The inspiration for this design came from the [Morehouse College website](https://morehouse.edu).

This repository is essentially a collection of ideas and brainstorming for an upcoming website. Below are the links to my designs.
